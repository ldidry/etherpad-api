NAME
    Etherpad::API - Access Etherpad Lite API easily

DESCRIPTION
    [deprecated] Use Etherpad instead.

    This module inherits from Etherpad without changing a thing for
    compatibility with applications that still use it.

    This module will be removed after 18 July 2016. It will not get any
    update.

    To use Etherpad, just change Etherpad::API in your code to Etherpad. The
    methods are the same as the previous release of Etherpad::API, plus a
    few more.

INSTALL
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

    If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.
